        My name is Jacob Arndt and I am a Masters student at the University of Minnesota studying geographic information science. In addition, I am also pursuing a graduate minor in computer science. Before beginning my Masters, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science in geography and a Bachelor of Arts in music. I was first drawn to geography as an undergraduate student while taking a biogeography course. It was there that I discovered a passion for science and what soon became my primary interest, climatology. After declaring a major in geography, I began taking courses in GIS and quickly found myself enjoying its technical and analytical aspects as well as appreciating its utility and importance to a broad range of application areas. My interest in GIS and spatial computing revolves around my deep interest in its development and application to studying the earth system and earth/environmental science data. Application areas within earth/environmental science that I'm particularly interested in are climatology, ecology, forestry, natural resources, and social vulnerability in the context of climate change and extremes.

        I find it difficult to summarize my interests in a single paragraph. I have had a broad range of experiences, opportunities, and interactions as a student which have all shaped my interests and skills one way or another. As a result, I have been exposed to a variety of disciplines within geography - all of which have helped me become well-rounded and have provided me with a broad range of valuable skills.

        Immediately following undergraduate graduation I had the opportunity to travel to California with Dr. Dan Griffin (Department of Geography, University of Minnesota) to conduct field work.

        I have experience with a wide variety of data, with climate data being the most familiar.

        <br>
        My primary interests lie at the intersection of the climate system, spatio-temporal data, remote sensing, machine learning, and GIS.
