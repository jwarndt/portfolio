        <hr class="my-4">
        I am a Masters student at the University of Minnesota studying geographic information science and computer science. Before beginning my Masters, I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Science in geography and a Bachelor of Arts in music. I was first drawn to geography as an undergraduate student while taking a biogeography course. It was there that I discovered a passion for science and what soon became my primary interest, climatology. After declaring a major in geography, I began taking courses in GIS and quickly found myself enjoying its technical and analytical aspects. I was also impressed by its utility and importance in a broad range of application areas and topics relevant to everyday society. My interest in GIS and spatial computing revolves around my deep interest in its development and application to studying the earth system and earth/environmental science data. I'm particularly interested in GIS and spatial computing and its use in climatology, ecology, forestry, natural resources, machine learning, and the study of social vulnerability in the context of climate change and extremes. My interest in how the natural world changes over time has also led me towards a general interest in spatio-temporal data.

        I find it difficult to summarize my interests in a single paragraph and so to get a better sense of who I am and my skills, take a look through my academic and professional experiences as well as my projects and research. I have had a broad range of experiences and opportunities as a student which have all shaped my interests and skills in one way or another. I have also had the good fortune to befriend and interact with a number of incredible mentors and teachers. As a result, I have been exposed to a variety of disciplines (some not related to GIS) - all of which have helped me become a well-rounded individual with a broad range of skills.
